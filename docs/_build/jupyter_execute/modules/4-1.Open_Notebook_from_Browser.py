# # 4-1: Open Notebook from Your Web browser

# So far, we have been using Python (Jupyter) Notebook from ArcGIS Pro.
# The benefit of this approach is that it integrates well with the GIS software.

# However, this approach currently has a big limitation is that you cannot
# force shutdown or terminate the Kernel of Jupyter Notebook without closing and
# reopening ArcGIS Pro altogether.
# 
# In a situation like a "endless loop", intentional or not, this feature is
# definitely of great usage.

# Fortunately, we can open the Jupyter Notebook from your web browser.

# ### Step 1: Open Python Command Prompt

# ### Step 2: Run Jupyter Notebook from a folder

# `jupyter notebook "<path to the notebook's parent folder>"`
