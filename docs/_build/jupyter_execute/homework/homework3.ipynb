    "## Program Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "Two scripts are required: the main script (`.ipynb` file) and a module script (`.py` file).\n",
    "\n",
    "The module script should contain **8** functions, one for each of the conversions above. e.g., the function to convert feet to miles could be called `feet2miles`.\n",
    "It should take one numeric parameter (assumed to be the amount in feet) and should return the corresponding amount converted to miles. e.g., if we pass **5280** to the `feet2miles` function, it should return **1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the main script runs, it should prompt the user to enter a numeric amount in the interactive window, as below.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure that the amount entered is a **positive** <u>valid number</u>, which can be either an integer or floating-point number.\n",
    "2. Once the number is entered and validated, prompt the user with a list of conversion options (see below).\n",
    "3. Check to make sure that the user chose one of the numbers between 1 and 8 (since 8 conversions are offered).\n",
    "4. Any other character should not be accepted, and the user should be asked to try again and enter a valid number between 1 and 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the conversion option is chosen, you should display the results as follows: `xx input_unit = yy` output_unit e.g. `5280 Feet = 1 Mile` or `1 Square Mile = 640 Acres`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, prompt the user if they would like to **continue or not**.\n",
    "If they choose to continue, prompt them again to enter a numeric value.\n",
    "This should continue until the user chooses to stop.\n",

    "Make sure anticipate input errors e.g., if a user enters an amount thatâ€™s not a valid number e.g. **80a2g** or negative value **-50**.\n",
