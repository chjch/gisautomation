# ## Homework 4
# ### Assignment
# 1. Work on the problem in Homework 1. Please go back to the `Homework1_ModelBuilder.pdf` from the first module and view the assignment instruction. 
# 2. However, other than solving the problem using ModelBuilder, you are asked to tackle the problem **using ArcPy functions**, just as the instructor did in the second lecture in Module 4.
# 3. For criterion (a), i.e., _"completely within 6 miles of I-75"_, you **must use "Select by Location"**.
# 4. For criterion (b), i.e., "_within Alachua County boundary_" you **must use "Select by Attributes"** in ArcPy to select records whose `COUNTY` field equals to `'001'`.
# 
# ### File to Submit
# - Put all the codes in this Jupyter Notebook.
# - Rename this Jupyter Notebook (the .ipynb file) as ```HW4_<LASTNAME>.ipynb```, e.g., ```HW4_CHEN.ipynb```.
# - Submit this Jupyter Notebook no later than the deadline posted in the course schedule on Canvas.
