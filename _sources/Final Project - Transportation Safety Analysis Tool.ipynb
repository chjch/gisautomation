Due to limited budget, they must be strategic on how they target the intervention areas and prioritize their resources. They require some assistance to identify priority areas that are expected to provide most improvements for their effort. More specifically, they need to identify areas based on the following criteria:"

Based on these requirements, create suitability raster grids for each of these proximity layers and categorize them in 9 classes (1 to 9) by using “natural breaks” classification. The extent and mask for all rasters is the county boundary and the _cell size is 30 (meters)_.\n",
