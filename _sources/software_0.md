# Software

We mainly use **ArcGIS Pro** for this course.

The main editor, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will be
**Jupyter Notebook**.
ArcGIS Pro supports running **_Python Notebook_**, a variant of Jupyter
Notebook, natively within its Graphical User Interface (GUI).

We are also going to use **Zoom** for presenting homework and for office hours.
